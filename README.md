 ### Project Description:
 ---------
 Think about a place that you love. Why do you love it, and how would you share that place with someone? In Peter Kageyama's book For the Love of Cities, he found that what made people love their cities was the small, intimate experiences. Things like a tree in your favorite park, a dish from a restaurant, a public mural, or local traditions. If those experiences exist, how do we connect people with them?   

    ScavyApp's mission is to provide tools to create unique experiences and explore the places our users love through Scavenger Hunt games.  

    With ScavyApp, users can create games for a private group or the entire world.  
    
    Clues take players on an adventure using geolocation check-ins.  
    
    Virtual games without using geolocation will provide accessible options for all.  
    
    Several intended uses for these games include a unique guide for tourist landmarks, an ice breaker for organizations, or a party game for friends and family.
